# hello-world
For testing and storing useful resources.
Currently building a website based on a Java application developed in Spring with a MSSQL backend to better understand the enterprise-level version used in my workplace. To mimic the example at work, I will code in Groovy and Javascript using AngularJS for the structure and compile the project into a war file using Gradle, Bower and Grunt to be hosted on an Apache web server on my laptop.
Will use this repository to store helpful code examples and reference materials.
